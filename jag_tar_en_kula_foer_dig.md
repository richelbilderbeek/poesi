# Jag Tar En Kula För Dig

> Den här är bara en skiss

## Explanation

'Jag tar en kula för dig' is a Swedish song,
in which the protagonists will take a bullet for his love.
This is intended to be romantic: the protagonist values his beloved
more than himself.
However, I think this is not romantic at all:

  1. If I have an idea, for example, a radical idea, I take this into account
     when going public with this: I already accept that there is a chance
     to be shot. Having a lover that would allow him/herself to be shot
     for my idea only makes it more complex for me, as now I need to take
     into account *two* people possibly getting shor
  2. If my lover takes a bullet for me, I will need to live with the guilt
     for the rest of my life
