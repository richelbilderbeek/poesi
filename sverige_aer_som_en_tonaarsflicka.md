# Sverige Är Som en Tonårsflicka

...

## Explanation

Sweden comes across as a 10-year-old examplary (i.e. according to a school
teacher) girl. 
These type of girls don't smoke tobacco (maybe snus), 
drink too much alcohol (if at all),
do sports and all those other examplary things.
It is fine when people follow all these rules.
However, making it a taboo to smoke tobacco or 
make it hard to obtain alcohol (among others, Systemet)
is something a regular (?Dutch) grown-up would not do;
here Sweden is like a 10-year old girl.
